# Core Rebuild Progress Log

This is the lane log for the Senior Capstone Core Hosted-App Rebuild automation.

Each rebuild run should append a dated entry with:

- automation ID
- master-plan section advanced
- source docs/logs read
- backlog or handoff IDs selected
- bounded scope
- files changed or artifact links
- validation
- self-improvement result
- commit/push status
- next action

## Entries

### 2026-05-18 07:14 PT - Lane Log Created

- `automation`: ops review of `senior-capstone-rebuild-rebuilt`
- `master-plan section`: Logging Requirements; Anti-Drift Rules
- `scope`: Create the missing core rebuild lane log required by the live automation prompt and shared cadence docs.
- `reason`: `senior-capstone-rebuild-rebuilt` is instructed to read `docs/progress/rebuild.md`, but the file did not exist during automation review.
- `validation`: Added this file and updated the automation contract checker to require it.
- `self-improvement`: none; no live automation prompt/config change was needed.
- `next action`: First rebuild automation run should append its own bounded product slice entry here before updating the shared run log.
